# Hospital-Billing-System-Using-C

This is a fully functional project developed in C with a clear structure for educational purposes.  It was created as a university project and is open-source and freely available for modification and updates. Check the README for further details.

The project source has been fully developed and designed by Niki. I hereby confirm that there are no copyrights in this repository. However, for the presentation, there were a few contributions made by my team members, and I would like to credit them as well.

Team: Niki, Mr. Dilshan, Mr. Sasinda, and Mr. Nawod (Rosa).

All the variables and functions are clearly defined. Study them before making changes to the source. Some states are used as common in the functions. So, make sure there are no conflicts after modifying those variables.

We have covered the basics of C Language in this project. The concepts used are described below:

1. Local variables
2. Global variables
3. Structures
4. Functions (with and without formal parameters)
5. Void methods and returning methods
6. In-Built Methods. (Ex: Strcpy, Strcat..)
7. Loops (Ex: While, For)
8. Switch Case
9. Conditions (If, Else-If)
10. Break and Continue
11. Libraries
12. File Handling
